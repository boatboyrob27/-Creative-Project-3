# -Creative-Project-3

My basic idea for this assignment was too create images that were so outside the box, that AI itself would be confused at the prompts I had given. I started out with a giant pengquin, moved onto a lego brick, and finished off with a waffle holding a banana. I learned a lot about both systems I used, Firefly and MidJourney. Each gave me their own specific problems which were solved through numerous generations of the same prompt. The main problem I had with firefly was trying to combine multiple subjects such as, banana and waffle. I would get one subejct over the other or it would try and combine both in an odd and unsettling way. Midjourney's one problem was adding artistic balances and effects to the generations. Firefly does have the effect selection option so that was super helpful and cool to mess around with but when trying to word out the effects on Midjourney in different ways, it still did not come out as I was expecting. My first take of Firefly was not the greatest as I had my doubts, but after playing around with all the effects, I realized it all depends on the prompt and the right effects.
